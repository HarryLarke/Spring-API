Welcome to my first SpringBoot project: A simple Rest API.

This project will utilise a N-Tier structure, implementing SpringJPA connecting to a containerised Postgres DB. Basic CRUD, logging and actuating will be used. Essentially creating a simple and deployable API.

With the potential of implementing SpringSecurity in the near future.
